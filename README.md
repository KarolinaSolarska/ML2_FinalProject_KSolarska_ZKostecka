# ML2_FinalProject_KSolarska_ZKostecka

This project was created for credit in the Machine Learning 2 course, and includes two projects Classifications and Regressions. 

In the Classifications folder you can find data and html version of codes with interpretations and comments. You have also version i RMD file in 'scripts' folder. In the project "Predicting Patient Survival in Critical Illnesses," we employed advanced machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model focused on enhancing the accuracy of survival predictions for critically ill patients. Central to our methodology was the implementation of the Random Forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning technique known for its robustness and ability to handle large datasets with high dimensionality. This model was meticulously tuned and validated to ensure optimal performance, demonstrating significant predictive capabilities across various critical illness scenarios.
